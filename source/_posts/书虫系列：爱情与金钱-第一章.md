#### 正文 

克拉克森一家居住在靠近剑桥的郊区，距离最近的村庄有半英里，距离康桥河有一英里。他们有一栋大面积的老房子，屋后是一个漂亮的花园，里面有很多花和大树。

正值七月，在某个周四的早上，杰基从花园进入屋内。她是一个高个子的胖女人，今年三十岁。虽然现在是一年中最热的时候，但是她却穿了一条亮棕色的裙子和黄色衬衣。她刚要去厨房喝点水，这时候电话响了。

“剑桥1379号”，杰基回应道。

“你好，我是戴安娜，我想和老妈聊一句。”

“老妈不在家”，杰基答复道，“她看医生去了。”

“为什么去看医生？老妈怎么了？”

“没什么大碍”，杰基说，“你为什么打电话回家？周末准备回来吗？老妈希望你们都回家。”

“恩，我想回去，”迪恩说，“我打电话是因为我没有钱买回家的火车票了。”

“没钱！老妈一直给你寄钱！”

“不多说了，电话费很贵，”迪恩冷淡地辩解道，“告诉老妈，我需要钱买票。”

杰基放下电话，从包里拿出一根烟然后抽了起来。她妹妹一直向家里要钱让她很生气。戴安娜今年二十岁，是家里最小的孩子，现在在伦敦生活，住在一个大房子的单间里。

她想成为一名歌手。她歌唱得很好但是从不愿意找工作。

杰基回到厨房准备做些三明治。这时候后门开了，她妈妈回来了。

“真热！”茉莉说道。她脱下她的帽子放在桌上。她是一个高个子的黑人妇女，有一双美丽的眼睛。
两条大黑狗跟随茉莉来到厨房，径直跑到她身边围着她转。她坐了下来，摸着它们的头。

杰基把做好的三明治放桌上。“老妈，”她说道，“戴安娜打了电话回来，她想要一些钱用来买火车票。”

茉莉闭着眼睛沉思了一会，然后站了起来。“我希望你下午整理一下房子为周末的家庭聚会做准备，”她说道，“哦，还有麻烦你晚点去趟镇上帮我把药拿回来。”

“好的，妈妈，”杰基答复道。

茉莉走向厨房门口。

“妈，稍等一下，”杰基喊道，“彼得.霍布斯早上来了一趟，他对你的那封信很生气，你知道的，他为此丢了工作。你为什么写信给他的上司？他想找你问清楚这个问题。”

“好啦，我不想和他讨论这个。”茉莉说道，然后打开厨房门准备离开。

“但是，老妈，你有所不知，他才17岁，那是它的第一份工作。他真的很生气，还说...要杀了你。”

茉莉没有做声。她离开了这个房间并关上了门。

1 Chapter

The Clarkson family lived in the country near Cambridge，about half a mile from the nearest village and about a mile from the river．They had a big，old house with a beautiful garden，a lot of flowers and many old．trees．

One Thursday morning in July，Jackie came in from the garden．She was a tall，fat woman，thirty years old．It was the hottest day of the year，but she wore a warm brown skirt and yellow shirt．She went into the kitchen to get a drink of water．Just then the phone rang．

'Cambridge 1379，'Jackie said．

'Hello．This is Diane．I want to talk to Mother．'

'Mother isn't here，'Jackie said．'She's at the doctor's．'

'Why？What's Wrong？'

'Nothing's wrong，'Jackie said．'Why are you telephoning？ You are going to come this weekend？ Mother wants everyone to be here．'

'Yes，I want to come，'Diane said．'I'm phoning because I have no money for the train ticket．'

'No money！Mother is always giving you money！'

'This phone call is very expensive，'Diane said coldly．'Tell Mother please．I need the money．'

Jackie put the phone down．She took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke．“her sister al-ways asked for money．Diane was twenty years old， the youngest in the family．She lived in London，in one room of a big house．

She wanted to be a singer．She sang very well but she could never get work．

Jackie went back into the kitchen and began to make some sandwiches．Just then the back door opened，and her mother came in．

'It's very hot！'Molly said．She took off her hat and put it down on the table．She was a tall，dark woman with beautiful eyes．

Two big，black dogs came into the kitchen after her and ran across to her．She sat down and put her hands on their heads．

Jackie put the sandwiches on the table．'Mother，'she said，'Diane phoned．She wants money for her train ticket．'

Molly closed her eyes for a minute．Then she stood up．'This afternoon I want you to get the house ready for the weekend，'she said．'Oh，and please go to the village later and get my tablets．'

'Yes，Mother，'Jackie said．

Molly went to the door．

'Mother，please wait a minute，'Jackie said．'Peter Hobbs came here this morning．He's very angry with you about that letter．He lost his job，you know．Why did you write to his office？He wants to talk to you about it．'

'Well，I don't want to talk to him，'Molly said．She opened the door．

'But Mother，you don't understand．He's seventeen，and it was his first job．He's very，very angry．He says… he says he's going to kill you！'

Molly did not answer．She went out of the room and closed the door．
