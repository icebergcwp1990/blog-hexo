#### 正文 

警察很快就到了。他们来了很多人。一些警察带着相机去楼上莫莉的房间。两个侦探在厨房与帕瑞特医生谈话。这个家族成员在会客厅等候。今天又是一个大热天，窗户都是开着的。狗狗们安静在依偎在戴安娜脚下。房间里一片沉默。杰基抽着烟。他们等了很长时间。突然门开了，两位侦探走了进来。

“早上好，我是华莱士探长，这是佛斯特探员。”探长面无笑容。他是一个大块头，穿着一条老旧的黑裤，戴着一顶黑帽子和披着外套。他穿外套是因为他总觉得冷。“昨天晚上有人在克拉克森女士的热牛奶里面放了安眠药。我们将要询问每一个人，麻烦安排一间房间。”

罗格站了起来。“我是罗格·克拉克森。你们可以用我父亲的旧办公室。跟我来，就在这里。”

办公室不是很大，但是有一张桌子和3、4张椅子。罗格打开了房间的窗户。

“我想首先和你阿尔伯特姨夫谈谈，”华莱士探长说道。他摘下帽子和脱下外套，然后坐在办公桌后面。

“当然可以，”罗格回答道，然后离开了房间。

佛斯特探员在门口守着。他是一位个子很高的小伙子，一头黑发，笑起来很好看。他早上不是很高兴，因为他通常会在周末的早晨打网球。他是剑桥网球俱乐部最好的球员之一。

阿尔伯特走了进来，然后坐下。

“我打算问你一些问题，金先生，”探长说道，佛斯特探员正准备做笔录。

阿尔伯特看着他的脚。“是，是，这是你们的职责，我知道。”

“跟我讲述一下关于昨天晚上的事情。”华莱士探长平静地说。

“你对克拉克女士很生气。”

阿尔伯特这才目视华莱士探长。“是的，我很生气。每个人都很生气。罗格很生气。戴安娜想要钱去美国。然后，有个叫汤姆·布雷格的男人。。。他想要花园的一半作为他的农场。莫莉是一个富有的女人。我需要钱，因为我的妻子-莫莉的姐姐-病的很严重。我和莫莉说过。”

“接下来发生什么？”

“接着，莫莉对每个人都很生气，然后上楼去了。我们其他人去了厨房喝咖啡。杰基想要我们都去楼上和莫莉道晚安。她和莫莉住这里，所有她想让莫莉开心点。罗格第一个不愿意，他很生气，不想见他妈妈。”
“然后你去莫莉的房间见她了吗？”

“是的，我有点疲倦然后第一个上楼的。我去莫莉的房间，再一次向她要钱。但是被拒绝了-莫莉不会给姐姐钱。”阿尔伯特停了下来，用手捂着眼睛。

华莱士探长注视了阿尔伯特一会。“在你睡觉之后有听到动静吗？”

“我想所有人都去了莫莉的房间道晚安。后来，我听到有人。。。他或她下楼。那是午夜的事情了。”

“很好，金先生，谢谢你，你可以走了。”阿尔伯特离开了房间。

华莱士探长双手抱头。“几点了？我饿了。我们了解了很多，但是我需要喝点咖啡。”

“那我去厨房吧？”佛斯特探员问道。

“欧，先不用。接下来我们见见杰基·克拉克森。”

杰基走了进来然后坐下。她低下头看着自己的手，一言不语。

“说说，你妈妈去过村里的药店拿药吗？”

“是的，我妈妈通常晚上都会吃一片安眠药，所有她需要很多药。有时候她去药店取，有时候我去。这周四，我让皮特·霍布斯去取得药。他住在马路对面的房子，经常骑自行车去村里。”

“我知道了。你妈妈想留着这间房子。你呢？你想搬离吗？”

杰基抬头片刻然后又低于看着她的手，说道。“这是妈妈的房子。我爱我妈妈。她对我很好。”

“昨晚你去你妈妈的房间看她了？”

“是的，大家都去了。戴安娜给妈妈热了一杯牛奶，妈妈通常会在睡觉前喝一杯热牛奶。”

华莱士探长双手枕在脑后。杰基显得很平静。“你妈妈说了什么？”

杰基打开她的背包找香烟。问道：“我能抽烟吗？”

“当然可以，这是你家，”华莱士探长回答道。他看着杰基。“你妈妈说了什么？”他又问了一遍。

“她想下楼去，她想起狗狗们-她想给它们弄点晚饭。我回到了自己的房间，然后她下楼去了。”

“大概什么时候？”

“我不记得了。差不多午夜。”

“那杯热牛奶在吗？”

“它放在她床边的桌子上。”

“你需要你妈妈的钱吗？”

“不，探长。钱对我来说不重要。还有比钱更重要的东西。”杰基平静地回答道。

“好吧，你阿尔伯特姨父想要钱，汤姆·布雷格想要花园。你一无所求？”

杰基把烟熄灭，抬头看着探长。她的眼神突然变得愤怒。说道：“别忘了皮特·霍布斯。他因为我妈妈丢了工作。他想要杀了她，你知道的。至于戴安娜？你在她的包里发现了空药瓶。”

华莱士探长听得很仔细。回答道：“我们会找每个人问话，卡拉克森小姐。”

杰基沉默了片刻。问道：“你们需要来点三明治和咖啡吗？”

“啊哈，好，麻烦了！”华莱士探长温和地回答道。“我很喜欢三明治和咖啡。”

杰基离开了房间。华莱士探长思索着她为什么突然生气了?房子一片安静。

#### 原文

The police arrived very quickly．There were a lot of them．Some of them with cameras went upstairs to Molly's room．Two detectives talked to Dr Pratt in the kitchen．The family waited in the sitting room．It was a hot day again and the windows were open．The dogs sat quietly at Diane's feet．Nobody talked．Jackie smoked．They waited for a long time．Suddenly the door opened and the two detectives came in．

'Good morning．I am Detective Inspector Walsh and this is Sergeant Foster．'The Inspector did not smile．He was a big man in an old black suit and a black hat and coat．

He wore a coat because he always felt cold．'Last night someone put sleeping tablets in Mrs Clarkson's hot milk．We are going to question everybody，and we need a room，please．'

Roger stood up．'I'm Roger Clarkson．You can have my father's old office．Come with me，it's along here，'

The office was not a very big room，but there was a table and three or four chairs．Roger opened the window．

'I would like to talk first to your uncle，Albert King，'In-spector Walsh said．He took off his hat and coat and sat down behind the table．

'Of course，'said Roger and left the room．

Sergeant Foster waited by the door．He was a very tall young man with black hair and a nice smile．He was not very happy this morning because he usually played tennis on Sunday mornings．He was one of the best players at the Cambridge Tennis Club．

Albert came in and sat down．

'I'm going to ask some questions，Mr King，'the Inspector said，'and Sergeant Foster is going to write it all down．'

Albert looked at his feet．'Yes，yes．It's your job．I know that．'

'Tell me about last night，'Inspector Walsh asked quietly．'You were angry with Mrs Clarkson．'

Albert looked at Inspector Walsh for the first time．'Yes，I was．Everyone was angry．Roger was angry．Diane wanted money to go to America．Then there's a man called Tom Brig-gs…He wants half the garden for his farm．Molly was a rich woman．I need money because my wife Annie—Molly's sister—is very ill．I told Molly this．'

'What happened next？'

'Well，Molly was angry with everyone and went upstairs．We went into the kitchen for coffee．Jackie wanted everyone to go up and say good night to Molly．She lives here with Molly so she wanted Molly to be happy．At first Roger said no．He was angry and didn't want to see his mother．'

'And did you see Molly in her room？'

'Yes．I was tired and I went upstairs first．I went to Molly's room and asked her for money again．But no—there was no money for her sister．'Albert stopped and put his hand over his eyes．

Inspector Walsh watched Albert for a minute．'Did you hear noises after you went to bed？'

'Everyone went into Molly's room to say good night，I think．Later，I heard someone…He—or she—went down－stairs．That was about midnight．'

'Very well，Mr King．Thank you，you can go now．'Albert left the room．

Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head．'What time is it？I'm hungry．We're learning a lot，but I need some coffee．'

'Shall I go to the kitchen？'Sergeant Foster asked．

'Oh，no．Later．Let's see Jackie Clarkson next．'

Jackie came in and sat down．She looked down at her hands and said nothing．

'We found the empty bottle of your mother's sleeping tablets in Diane's room，'the Inspector said suddenly．Then he waited．Jackie's face did not change and she said nothing．

'Tell me，did your mother get her tablets from the shop in the village？'

'Yes．My mother usually took a sleeping tablet every night so she needed a lot of tablets．Sometimes she got them from the shop，sometimes I did．On Thursday，I asked Peter Hobbs to get them．He lives in the house across the road，and he of－ten goes to the village on his bicycle．'

'I see．Your mother wanted to stay in this house．How about you？Did you want to move？'

Jackie looked up for a minute and then down at her hands a－gain．'This is Mother's house．I loved my mother．She was good to me．'

'Did you see your mother in her room last night？'

'Yes，everyone did．Diane made hot milk and took it to Mother．She usually drank a cup of hot milk before she slept．'

Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head．Jackie was very quiet．'What did your mother say？'

Jackie opened her bag and looked for a cigarette．'Can I smoke？'

'Of course．This is your house，'Inspector Walsh said．He watched Jackie．'What did your mother say？'he asked again．

'She wanted to go downstairs again．She remembered the dogs—she wanted to get some dinner for them． I went to my room and she went downstairs．'

'What time was this？'

'I don't remember．About midnight，I think．'

'And the cup of hot milk？'

'It was on the table by her bed．'

'Did you need your mother's money？'

'No，Inspector．Money is not important to me．There are more important things，'Jackie said quietly．

'Well，your uncle Albert wanted money．Tom Briggs wanted the garden．You wanted nothing？'

Jackie finished her cigarette and looked up at the Inspector．Her eyes were suddenly angry．'Don't forget Peter Hobbs．He lost his job because of my mother．He wanted to kill her，you know．And what about Diane？You found the empty bottle in her bag．'

Inspector Walsh listened carefully．'We're going to question everyone，Miss Clarkson．'

Jackie said nothing for a minute．'Would you like some sandwiches and coffee，Inspector？'

'Ah！Yes，please！'Inspector Walsh said warmly．'I would like sandwiches and coffee very much．'

Jackie left the room．Inspector Walsh thought about her．Why was she suddenly angry？The room was quiet．
