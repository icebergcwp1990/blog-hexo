第二天一大早，房子一切平静。突然，从罗格隔壁的房间里传来一阵哭声，那是他妈妈的房间。罗格睁开眼睛看了看时间，现在是将近7点钟。他走下床然后轻轻地的打开门。与此同时，她妈妈的房间也是打开了，戴安娜从里面走出来，她的脸色显得很苍白。

“罗格!妈妈她！我刚给她送一杯咖啡过来然后发现她已经死了。她死了。。。死在床上。”她哭着说。

罗格马上走到他妈妈的房间门口往里面看去。窗户是打开的但是房间是暖和的。莫莉躺在床上，一只手枕在头下。罗格径直走到床边，把手放在她妈妈的手臂上。莫莉的身体已经冷了。在床边的小桌上是一杯热咖啡和一个空杯子。

“我去打电话给医生，”戴安娜说

“她死了，”罗格缓慢地说道，他的脸也变得苍白。“妈妈死了！”

戴安娜走到房间的门口。“我去打电话给医生，”她又说道

“等一下！”罗格喊道，“我们先告诉其他家庭成员。”

“其他人！没人爱妈妈！”戴安娜走出房间然后走下楼。

罗格跟在后面慢慢地走下楼然后站在电话旁边。

“普拉特医生，我是戴安娜·克拉克森。我的妈妈-她死了，你能马上过来吗？”

戴安娜放下电话。“这不是真的，罗格！妈妈死了！爸爸去年冬天过世，现在妈妈也死了。”戴安娜开始哭了起来。

“别哭了，戴安娜，”罗格说道。“我们上楼去告诉阿尔伯特姨父和杰基。”

“不，你去告诉他们!没人是爱妈妈的。你们不必难过。看看你们，你们想要她的钱。不过如此。”

罗格突然想揍戴安娜。“安静点！”他反驳道。“你呢？你不爱妈妈，你也只是惦记她的钱。别说风凉话！”

“没错，”戴安娜说道。“哦，我不能再呆在这房里了。我要出去透透气。我要带狗去河边。”

“不行，”罗格说道。“医生快到了，我想要你留在这里。”

戴安娜一言不发。她走进厨房，狗也立刻跟了过去。“多漂亮的狗!爸爸爱你们，妈妈也爱你们。现在我会爱你们的。”她打开后门，带着狗一起出去了。

罗格停留在原地，站在电话旁边。“没错，”他心想，“我喜欢钱。我需要钱，而且我现在富裕了。事情对我来说都变得容易。但是妈妈...我为什么不多疼爱她一点？可现在她死了。”罗格慢慢地走上楼，他想在普拉特医生到来之前穿好衣服。

普拉特医生是一个发福的矮个子，头发比较少。他是这个家族的医生，他对所有克拉克森家族成员都很了解。他立刻上楼查看莫莉的尸体。他仔细端详床边上的那杯咖啡和空杯子。

“抱歉，罗格，”他说道。“戴安娜人呢？是她打电话给我的。”

“她带着狗出去了，”罗格回答说，“她冲我发火-冲每个人发火。”

普拉特医生沉默片刻，“事情变得棘手，我得打电话给警察，罗格。”

“报警！为什么？发生什么事了？”

“我也不清楚。你妈妈之前没有生病。我周四见她的时候，她状态很好。她为什么会死？我无法理解。我要查明真相。”

罗格走到窗前向花园望去。这是夏天一个美丽的早晨。天空蔚蓝，花园翠绿。一切都很平静。他的妈妈很喜爱这个花园。但是汤姆·布雷格想占为己有。然而罗格也想要这个花园。罗格觉得事情越来越糟。

“你妈妈服用了安眠药，”普拉特医生说道。“你知道吗？她周四买了一瓶新的安眠药，但是在她房间没有找到”

“我不知道，”罗格回答道。“好吧，我们下楼，你可以报警。”

罗格走进厨房弄了点咖啡。恰好这时候戴安娜带着狗走进来。

“罗格，”她说。“听我说，我很抱歉。我刚才因为生气说了一些气话。”

“没事。”罗格回答道。“给，喝点咖啡。普拉特医生正在打电话给警察。你知道妈妈服用了安眠药吗？唷，药瓶没有在她房间。”

“什么？我没搞明白。”戴安娜接过咖啡正准备喝。她的眼睛看起来又大又黑。

刚好这时普拉特医生来的厨房，“警察马上就到，”他说，“戴安娜，我为你妈妈难过。”

“普拉特医生，我想告诉你昨晚发生的事情。所有人都很生气。。。”

“住口！”罗格急忙说。

“戴安娜开口前从来不过大脑的，”他生气地想。

戴安娜没有理罗格，“昨晚妈妈睡得很早，因为所有人。。。”

“别告诉我，”普拉特医生说，“你可以告诉警察。”

罗格的脸变得胀红。突然间他觉得有些害怕。“警察会找每一人谈话，然后问些问题，”他想。“他们想得到答案，这将会很棘手。”他喝完咖啡然后起身。

“我去楼上，”他说。“我准备去告诉阿尔伯特姨夫和杰基关于妈妈。。。还有报警的事情。”

Chapter 3 

Early next morning the house was quiet. Suddenly there was a cry from the room next to Roger's, his mother's room. Roger opened his eyes 
and looked at the clock. It was nearly seven o'clock.

He got out of bed and opened the door quietly. At the same time the door of his mother's room opened and Diane came out. Her face was very white. 

'Roger! It's Mother! I brought a cup of coffee for her and I found her dead. She's dead…dead in her bed,' she cried.

Roger went quickly to the door of his mother's room and looked in. The window was open but the room was warm. Molly was on the bed, one hand under her head. Roger went across to the bed and put his hand on her arm. It was cold. On the little table next to the bed was a hot cup of coffee and an empty cup. 

'I'm going to call the doctor,' Diane said.

'She's dead,' Roger said slowly. His face, too, was white. 'Mother is dead!' 

Diane walked across the room to the door. 'I'm going to phone the doctor,' she said again.

'Wait a minute!' Roger called. 'Let's tell the family first.'

'Family! Nobody loved Mother!' Diane went out and ran downstairs.

 Roger slowly went downstairs after her and stood by the telephone. 
 
 'Dr Pratt, this is Diane Clarkson. It's my mother—she's dead. Can you come quickly?' 
 
 Diane put the phone down. 'It isn't true, Roger! Mother dead! Daddy died last winter, and now Mother.' Diane began to cry.
 
 'Don't cry, Diane,' Roger said. 'Let's go upstairs and tell Uncle Albert and Jackie.'
 
'No! You tell them! Nobody loved Mother. You aren't sorry. Look at you! You want her money. That's all.' 

Roger suddenly wanted to hit Diane. 'Be quiet!' he said. 'What about you? You didn't love Mother. You wanted her money, too. Don't forget that!' 

'It's true,' Diane said. 'Oh, I can't stay in this house. I'm going out. I'm going to the river with the dogs.'

'No,' Roger said. 'The doctor's coming and I want you here.' Diane said nothing. She went into the kitchen and at once the dogs got up and came to her. 'Beautiful dogs! Daddy loved you and Mother loved you. Now I'm going to love you.' She opened the back door and went out with the dogs. 

Roger did not move. He stood by the telephone. 'It's true,' he thought. 'I am happy about the money. I needed money, and now I'm rich. Things are going to be easier for me now. But Mother…why didn't I love her more? And now she's dead.' Slowly, Roger went back upstairs. He wanted to dress before Dr Pratt arrived. 

Dr Pratt was a little fat man without much hair. He was the family doctor and he knew all the Clarkson family very well. He went upstairs at once and looked at Molly's body. He looked carefully at the cup of coffee and the empty cup on the table next to her bed. 

'I'm sorry, Roger,' he said. 'Where is Diane? She phoned me.' 

'She went out with the dogs,' Roger said. 'She was angry with me—angry with everyone.' 

Dr Pratt said nothing for a minute. 'This is going to be very difficult. I'm going to phone the police, Roger.' 'Police! Why? What's wrong? 'I don't know. Your mother wasn't ill. I saw her on Thursday and she was very well. Why did she die? I don' t understand. I want to find out.' 

Roger went across to the window and looked out at the garden. It was a beautiful summer  morning. The sky was blue and the garden was green. It was all very quiet. His mother loved this garden. But Tom Briggs wanted the garden. And Roger wanted the garden, too. Roger felt worse and worse. 

'Your mother took sleeping tablets,' Dr Pratt said. 'Did you know? On Thursday she had a new bottle of tablets, but I can't find it here in her room.'

'I didn't know,' Roger said. 'Very well. Let's go down-stairs and you can phone the police.'

Roger went into the kitchen and made some coffee. Just then Diane came in with the dogs. 

'Roger,' she said. 'Look, I'm sorry. I was angry and said some angry things.' 

'It doesn't matter,' Roger said. 'Here you are, have some coffee. Dr Pratt is phoning the police. Did you know Mother took sleeping tablets? Well, the bottle is not in her room.'

'What? I don't understand.' Diane took the coffee and began to drink. Her eyes looked big and dark. 

Just then Dr Pratt came into the kitchen. 'They're coming at once,' he said. 'Diane—I'm sorry about your mother.'

'Dr Pratt, I want to tell you about last night.Everyone was very angry…'

'Be quiet!' Roger said quickly.

'Diane never thinks before she opens her mouth,' he thought angrily. 

Diane did not look at Roger. 'Last night Mother went to bed early because everyone…' 

'Don't tell me,' Dr Pratt said. 'You can tell the police.'

Roger's face went red. Suddenly he felt afraid. 'The police are going to talk to everyone, and ask questions,' he thought. 'And they're going to want answers. It's going to be very difficult.' He finished his coffee and stood up.

'I'm going upstairs,' he said. 'I'm going to tell Uncle Albert and Jackie about Mother…and about the police.'
