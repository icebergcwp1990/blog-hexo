After the coffee and sandwiches，Inspector Walsh called Roger Clarkson to the office．Roger came in and sat down．The Inspector began at once．

用完咖啡和三明治后，华莱士探长叫卡拉克森·罗格来办公室。罗格进来刚坐下，探长立刻开始询问。

'Now，Mr Clarkson．Why was your mother angry with you last night？'

“跟我说说，克拉克森先生，昨晚你妈妈为什么会对你生气？”

'This house is very big，'Roger said．'It was a lot of work for Mother．I wanted her to move．But no，she loved this house and garden．She didn't want to move．'

“这栋房子很大，”罗格解释道，“妈妈需要做很多家务。我希望她搬走。但是如今，她喜欢这房子和花园。她不想搬走。”

'Tell me about your job，Mr Clarkson．Your mother is dead and now you're rich．Do you need money？'

“谈谈你的工作，克拉克森先生。你妈妈去世了，现在你富有了。你需要钱吗？”

Roger's face was suddenly afraid．'What are you saying？I didn't kill my mother．I need money，that's true．A friend and I want to build ten houses here，in this garden．We can get a lot of money for them．So．I wanted Mother to sell this house．It's true．But Mr Briggs wanted half the garden，too，you know，for his farm．'

罗格的脸色突然变得惊慌。“你说什么？我没有杀我妈妈。我需要钱，那没错。我和一个朋友想在这里的花园建十栋房子。因此我们能赚很多钱。所以，我希望妈妈卖掉这栋房子。”

Inspector Walsh moved a pencil on the table．'Tell me，what happened upstairs？You went to your mother's room？'

华莱士警探摆弄着桌上的一支铅笔。说道：“告诉我，楼上发生了什么？你去了你妈妈的房间？”

'Yes，I did．I wanted to say goodnight to my mother．'

“是的，我去过。我想和我妈妈说声晚安。”

'Did you talk about the house again？'
“你又提及了关于房子的事情？”

'Yes，I did．Again，she said no．She loved the house and didn't want to sell it．'

“是的，我提了。她再次拒绝了。她喜欢这栋房子，不想出售。”

Inspector Walsh watched Roger for a minute．'I see．We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets，Mr Clarkson，in Diane's room．'

华莱士探长注视了罗格片刻。“我知道了。克拉克森先生，我们在戴安娜的房间发现了这个安眠药的空瓶子。”

Roger's face did not change．'Oh？Someone put them there．Diane did not kill my mother，I know that．She found the body．'

罗格的面不改色地说道：“哦？有人把它们放那里的。戴安娜没有谋杀我妈妈，我知道。她发现的尸体。”

'Very well．I would like to see Diane next．'

“很好，我打算接下来见见戴安娜。”

Roger got up and left the room．

“罗格起身离开了房间。”

Inspector Walsh stood up and put his hands in his pockets．He went to the window and looked out at the trees．Why was Roger Clarkson afraid？Was it important？He looked at Sergeant Foster．

华莱士探长站了起来，把双手放进口袋。他走向窗户，看着外面的树林。为什么克拉克森·罗格会惊慌？这个细节重要吗？他的目光转向佛斯特探员。

'Tomorrow morning，go to Mr Clarkson's office-you have the name，'he said．'Ask some questions about him，about his job，friends，money．'

“明天早上，去克拉克森先生的办公室-名字你知道的，”他说。“询问一些问题，关于他的工作，朋友，资产。”

Sergeant Foster wrote it down．'Yes，Inspector．'

佛斯特探员记录下来，说道：“好的，探长。”

'A good day for tennis，Sergeant？'

“适合打网球的好天气啊，探员？”

Sergeant Foster laughed．'Don't say that．It's not easy，you know．I don't like sitting here looking at the sun．'

佛斯特探员笑道。“别提了。难受，你知道的。我不喜欢坐在这里看着太阳。”

Diane came into the room and sat down．She looked at Sergeant Foster and smiled．'I saw you at the Tennis Club last month，I think．You play very well．'

戴安娜来到房间坐下。她看着佛斯特探员，然后微微一笑。“我想我上个月在网球俱乐部见过你，你球技很棒。”

Sergeant Foster's face went red．Inspector Walsh looked at him．'Oh yes．A fast and exciting player is Sergeant Foster．'

佛斯特探员脸红了。华莱士探长看着他，说道：“噢，是的。佛斯特探员是一个敏捷且充满激情的球手。”

Diane smiled again at Sergeant Foster and his face went redder．

戴安娜再次冲着佛斯特探员微笑，他的脸变得更红了。

'Well，Miss Clarkson，'Inspector Walsh said，'I want you to talk about last night．'

“好了，克拉克森小姐，”华莱士探长说道，“我想要你聊聊昨天晚上的事情。”

Diane stopped smiling．'Oh，I can talk about last night．I can't stop talking about it．We were all angry．Mother went to bed early and I made hot milk for her．We were all in the kitchen，and Peter Hobbs came in He nearly broke the back door down．'Diane stopped．

戴安娜止住了笑声。“噢，我可以聊聊昨晚的事情。我忍不住谈论它。我们都在生气。妈妈早早地去睡觉了，我热了一杯牛奶给她。我们都在厨房，然后皮特·霍布斯进来了，他几乎要把后门踢破了。”戴安娜停住了。

'Yes？'

“是吗？”

'He was very angry about a letter．He wanted to kill Mother．Are you going to talk to him？'

“他对那封信很恼火。他想谋杀我妈妈。你们会找他谈话吗？”

'We're going to talk to everyone．'

"我们会和每个人谈话。"

'Good．Tom Briggs came into the kitchen，too．Are you going to talk to him？'

“那就好。汤姆·布雷格斯也来过厨房。你们会找他谈话吗？”

'I'm asking the questions，Miss Clarkson．When did you take the milk upstairs？'

“我正在问你问题，克拉克森小姐。你是什么时候端牛奶上楼的？”

'I went up after Roger．'She stopped for a minute．Then she began again．'I didn't like my mother，Inspector．She killed my father，you know．Last winter，after Christmas，she drove the car into a tree and killed my father．'

“我在罗格后面。”她停顿片刻。然后又继续说道。“我不喜欢我妈妈，探长。她害死我爸爸，你知道的。去年冬天，圣诞节后，她开车撞上了一颗树，害死了我爸爸。”

Inspector Walsh watched Diane's face carefully．'I see．So you wanted to kill your mother？'

华莱士探长仔细地注视着戴安娜的表情。“我了解了。所以你想谋杀你妈妈？”

Diane laughed．'I wanted to kill her，but I didn't．I can tell you a lot of things about this family，Inspector．Everyone wanted Mother to die．Uncle Albert wanted her money for his wife，Annie．And then my brother．He needs a lot of money．He has an expensive house and an expensive car．And think of Jackie．Do you know that Jackie didn't like Mother？A long time age，a nice boy worked here．He was the gardener．Jackie loved him very much，but Mother said no．A gardener was not a good husband for a Clarkson girl！'

戴安娜笑道：“我想杀了她，但是我没有。我可以告诉你关于这个家族的许多事情。每个人都想要我妈妈死掉。阿尔伯特姑父想要她的钱为他的妻子安妮治病。然后是我哥哥，他需要很多钱。他拥有一栋昂贵的房子和车子。还有想想杰基。你知道杰基不喜欢我妈妈吗？很久以前，一个不错的小伙子在这里工作。他是一个园丁。杰基很爱他，但是我妈妈不允许。一个园丁对克拉克森家的女儿来说不是一个好的丈夫人选！”

Inspector Walsh listened quietly．All this was very interesting but was it important？Perhaps．What a happy family the Clarksons were！

华莱士探长听得很仔细。所有的这些都很有趣但是这些重要吗？也许吧。克拉克森是一个多么快乐的家族啊！

'We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets in your room，'Inspector Walsh said quietly． He watched her face carefully．

“我们在你的房间发现了安眠药的空瓶子，”华莱士探长轻声说道。他仔细地注视着她的表情。

Diane stood up suddenly，her face angry．'What？I didn't put it there！I'm not going to listen to this！'She ran out of the room．

戴安娜突然站了起来，一脸愤怒。“什么？我没有把它们放那里！我不想听这些！”说完她跑出了房间。

'Well，well，well，'Inspector Walsh said．'She likes you，Sergeant．You need to be careful．'

“好吧，好吧，好吧，”华莱士探长说道。“她喜欢你，探员。你得当心点。”

Sergeant Foster laughed but his face went red again．
佛斯特探员笑了，但是他的脸又红了。

'Someone put sleeping tablets in Molly's hot milk，'the In-spector said．'All the family were in the kitchen last night．Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs were there，too．One of them killed Molly．'
"有人把安眠药放进了莫莉的热牛奶里，"探长说道。“所有的家庭成员昨晚都在厨房。皮特·霍布斯和汤姆·布雷格斯也那。他们其中的一个人杀了莫莉。”

Inspector Walsh got his hat and coat．'Come on．We need to talk to Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs．Let's get some more coffee first．I'd like a sandwich，too．I'm hungry again！'

华莱士探长拿起他的帽子和外套。说道：“走吧，我们需要和皮特·霍布斯和汤姆·布雷格斯聊聊。我们先再来点咖啡。我想来一块三明治。我又饿了！”
